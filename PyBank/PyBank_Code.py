#Using total_changes: This list contains all the calculated monthly changes, so you should sum this list to get the total change over all months.
#Using len(total_changes) gives you the number of changes recorded, which corresponds to the number of months minus the first month (January) since you started tracking changes from the second month onward.
#The if total_changes else 0 part is a safeguard to avoid division by zero in case there are no changes recorded (though in your case, there should always be at least one change).
